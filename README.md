Kinematics 3D with Laplacian Deformation

Implementation of a kinematic hierarchical model in processing (3D) using laplacian deformation.

This is an implementation in Processing of kinematic hierarchical model using a skeleton composed by hierarchical relations between joints as suggested in:

Additionally, it is used the Laplacian Operator to deform the vertices of the contour based on:
